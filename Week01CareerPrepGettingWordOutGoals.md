# Week 01 Career Prep: Getting the Word Out & Goals

## SMART Goals Research
Look up what a SMART goal is. Provide me with three sources that you looked up:
1. Source 1: [https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals]
2. Source 2: [https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-are-smart-goals]
3. Source 3: [https://absel-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/absel/article/view/90]

## Resume Improvements
Look at 3-4 other classmates’ posts and identify 2-4 items that you think are novel approaches to improving your resume or LinkedIn Profile:
1. Classmate 1: [ Cayleigh Leishman]
   - Novel Item 1: [Cayleigh already does by prioritizing her work over education and experience. However, she could further improve by replacing older projects with more recent ones to showcase her updated skillset, especially in JavaScript and UI design.]
   - Novel Item 2: [Cayleigh could do her projects (like the quilting website) directly to her HTML, CSS, and organizational skills to emphasize her hands-on experience.]
2. Classmate 2: [Mabel Heiner]
   - Novel Item 1: [Mabel uses keywords to describe her role and activities in projects, which is an effective way to make her resume stand out to potential employers who often scan for relevant skills.]
   - Novel Item 2: [She also emphasizes specific programming languages and experiential learning projects, making her resume more practical and skill-oriented, which can demonstrate real-world experience and proficiency.]

## Job Posting & Evaluation
Find 3-4 jobs that you would like to have applied for or recommend. Provide links. Why are they good matches? Evaluate them.
1. **Job Posting 1: [https://www.google.com/search?q=Software+Engineer%2C+Mid+-+Austin%2C+Remote&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA1039CA1039&oq=Software+Engineer%2C+Mid+-+Austin%2C+Remote&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigAdIBCDE3MzRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&jbr=sep:0]
   - **Why a good match**: [This position offers flexibility with remote options and focuses on software development, aligning with my background.]
   - **Equivalent**: [Strong match in languages like Python and tools such as Git and Docker.]
   - **Improvements**: [Could improve on specific domain knowledge in cloud-based architectures.]

2. **Job Posting 2: [https://www.levels.fyi/companies/palo-alto-networks/salaries/software-engineer/levels/software-engineer]
   - **Why a good match**: [Advanced role focusing on leadership and technical innovation, fitting my career trajectory.]
   - **Equivalent**: [Strong skills in leadership, programming languages (Java, Python), and architecture design.]
   - **Improvements**: [More experience needed in AI-based applications and scaling large systems.]

3. **Job Posting 3: [https://remote.com/jobs/reddit-c1ujjl13/staff-software-engineer-compute-reliability-and-efficiency-j185vc2v?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic]
   - **Why a good match**: [ Role aligns with distributed computing and large-scale data management.]
   - **Equivalent**: [Familiar with distributed systems, databases, and algorithm optimization.]
   - **Improvements**: [Need to enhance understanding of real-time machine learning frameworks.]

## SMART Goals
From the previous task, Job Posting & Evaluation, identify a common thread of improvements. Include a list of classmates that you looked at:
1. Classmate 1: [Cayleigh Leishman: Update the projects section of her resume with more recent work that showcases her improved JavaScript and UI/UX skills.]
2. Classmate 2: [Mabel Hainer:gaining practical experience through experiential learning projects aligns with the  full-stack development goal, by continuing to work on personal and collaborative coding projects.]

Based on this research, create two SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-based):
1. **SMART Goal from Classmate Feedback**:
   - Goal: [Based on feedback from my classmates, my SMART goal is to improve my presentation skills by actively participating in class discussions and giving at least two presentations by the end of the semester.]
2. **SMART Goal from Job Search**:
   - Goal: [To strengthen my job search, I will complete three certifications—Google Project Management, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, and Scrum Master Certification—by the end of the next quarter. ]
